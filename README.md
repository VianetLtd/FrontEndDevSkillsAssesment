# Front-End | README

To complete the following technical test, you will need the following program installed on your machine:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition ([https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&amp;rel=16](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&amp;rel=16))

This is the IDE we use daily for both front end and back end development.

Before you run the API, make sure within Visual Studio that the FrontEnd project is set as StartUp. Right click the FrontEnd project and click &quot;Set as Startup Project&quot;. Proceed to click the green play button at the top of the IDE to have the API available to use.

# Front-End | Technical Skill Assessment

A student will only pass the year if they have 3 grades, C or above.

Create a minor website/web application that connects to the provided API to output the following:

- A stylised version of the below table

- A page that allows for the students to be selected via a dropdown. When a student is selected, show their corresponding grades and courses. Format and style the page accordingly.

What we are looking for:

- Neat, readable code
- A good stylistic choice
- Don&#39;t worry if the test isn&#39;t 100%, do what you can and we will still assess what has been completed.
- If you have used any external library/framework which requires a download, please let us know.
- Once you&#39;re happy with your finished product, please ZIP up the contents and email: [james.stevenson@vianetplc.com](mailto:james.stevenson@vianetplc.com)
