# Front-End | README

To complete the following technical test, you will need the following program installed on your machine:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition ([https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&amp;rel=16](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&amp;rel=16))

This is the IDE we use daily for both front end and back end development.

Before you run the API, make sure within Visual Studio that the FrontEnd project is set as StartUp. Right click the FrontEnd project and click &quot;Set as Startup Project&quot;. Proceed to click the green play button at the top of the IDE to have the API available to use.
